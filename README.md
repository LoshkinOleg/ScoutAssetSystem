# Scout Asset System
My own barebones asset manager. Currently can read/write wav files using dr_wav.

# TODO:
- Implement wav data loading from disk in a streamed fashion.
- Implement json data loading from disk in an inline fashion (non-streamed).
- Implement bitmap data loading from disk in an inline fashion (non-streamed).
- Implement png data loading from disk in an inline fashion (non-streamed).
- Implement gpu compressed texture data loading from disk in an inline fashion (non-streamed).
